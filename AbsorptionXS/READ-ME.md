In the "Original" directory are the scattering and absorption cross-sections that were obtained from Nataly's old code (wavelength is in Angstroms, too). I reformatted them to make them look nice and converted wavelength to nm, also located in the "Original" directory.

Nataly was applying correction factors to them:
XS*1.674*1.0E-24 for H
XS*6.647*1.0E-24 for He
XS*19.94*1.0E-24 for C
I recalculated the cross-sections to include these correction factors in them, and that is what is contained within this directory.

The "Interpolated" directory contains just that, interpolated absorption cross-section values
